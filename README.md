**`Cybersecurity Estudent`**

Information Security undergraduate with a strong interest in various fields, including Cybersecurity, DevSecOps, programming, and the study of social engineering combined with Ethical Hacking.
Driven by challenging problems, I continuously seek to improve my skills through CTF platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe, along with bootcamps and certifications I plan to complete in the Cybersecurity field to grow and evolve as a professional.
